# Corona Overview

[niedersachsen.de](https://www.niedersachsen.de) and exports a short history for a list of locations.

## Gettings started

* download the [lastest release](https://github.com/mathisdt/corona-overview/releases/latest)
  and unpack it
* start it using the script contained in the "bin" directory or with `java -jar corona-overview.jar`
  and append a list of locations (which are in Lower Saxony) as parameters.
